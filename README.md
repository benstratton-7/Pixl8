# Pixl8
A tool to turn an input image into a new pixelated version that fits your color palette. Great for video game asset creation

The first version is working!
After many many hours of troubleshooting, I finally realized all my problems would be solved if i saved the output as a png. so now this app is designed to create a png image!
There is no polish or anything yet but if you know basic python you can definitely figure out how to use this. run in terminal and use the filepath of the image you want to pixl8 and it will run the program using my default palette.
