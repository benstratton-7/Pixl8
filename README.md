# Pixl8
A tool to turn an input image into a new pixelated version that fits your color palette. Great for video game asset creation

## Update Notes
version 1.0 is complete. I got a working gui up and running so you can just run gui.py, and go through the wizard to see how it works. It needs a lot of polish to be useable but this definitely is a good proof of concept/mvp type of thing!

## How to use
run gui.py, choose an image to pixl8, choose from the provided palettes(have to add the ability to upload your own palette later), and click process image! the final screen shows two version of your image. one is actual size relative to the window, and the other is blown up so you can see it better.
